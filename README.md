## Remark

> Please be aware that the actual design of a pediatric CT protocol for clinical use demands oversight by a qualified pediatric radiologist. The 'PedDesignCT' application serves as an initial planning, educational/inspirational tool, and is not designed for immediate clinical implementation. It is essential that any protocols generated by this app undergo a comprehensive review by specialists and be tailored specifically to align with the practices of your institution and the individual needs of each patient. This application is not a substitute for professional judgment and expertise."
